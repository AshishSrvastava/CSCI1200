Writing `if`, `if/elif/else` and `if/else` statements\n","\n","To write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. **Conditional statements**, sometimes also referred to as **selection statements**, give us this ability. <br>\n","The simplest form of selection is the `if` statement.  An `if` statement is a control structure that we use to create branches in our code. This means that our code can do one thing under certain circumstances and another thing under different circumstances. The syntax for an `if` statement in python is:\n","\n","```python\n","if logical_expression:\n","    # do something\n","    print(\"the logical expression evaluated to true!\") # for example\n","```\n","\n","In addition to `if`, we also learned how to write these statements with `else` branches in lecture to create more paths for our programs to take.\n","\n","```python\n","if logical_expression: # must always begin with \"if\"\n","    # do something\n","    print(\"first logical expression was true!\")\n","else:  # can have 0 or 1 else\n","    print(\"first logical expression was false!\")\n","```\n","\n","\n","## 1b. Adding in one more piece of the puzzle - `elif`\n","We can further increase the number of paths at a certain point by adding more branches to our conditionals in the form of one or more `elif`s.\n","\n","\n","```python\n","if logical_expression: # must begin with \"if\"\n","    # do something\n","    print(\"first logical expression was true!\")\n","elif logical_expression2: # can have 0 or more \"elif\"s\n","    print(\"first logical expression was false!\")\n","    print(\"second logical expression was true!\")\n","else:  # can have 0 or 1 else\n","    print(\"first logical expression was false!\")\n","    print(\"second logical expression was false!\")\n","```\n","\n","Note that we can use `elif` to create as many paths for our program as needed. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","if logical_expression: \n","    # do something\n","    print(\"first logical expression was true!\")\n","elif logical_expression2: \n","    print(\"first logical expression was false!\")\n","    print(\"second logical expression was true!\")\n","elif logical_expression3:\n","    print(\"first two logical expressions were false!\")\n","    print(\"third logical expression was true!\")\n","elif logical_expression4:\n","    print(\"first three logical expressions were false!\")\n","    print(\"fourth logical expression was true!\")\n","elif logical_expression5:\n","    print(\"first four logical expressions were false!\")\n","    print(\"fifth logical expression was true!\")\n","else: # Only goes in here if ALL of the logical expressions above were False\n","    print(\"Every logical expression above was false!\")\n","```\n","\n","Be aware that your program will stop evaluating a control structure on the FIRST logical expression it evaluates as true!
